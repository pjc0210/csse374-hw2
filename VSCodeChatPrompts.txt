using the repository as context:

Prompt 1:
using UMLDiagram-new.puml generate the code for a splendor game

Prompt 2:
create a nicer looking gui that also displays the cards and their cost

Prompt 3:
add the ability to draw white, green, blue, black, and red chips

Prompt 4:
have the game swap between 2 players

Prompt 5:
include logic to automatically swap turns when 2 tokens of the same color are drawn, 3 total tokens are drawn, or a card is bought

Prompt 6:
make sure a player cannot buy and draw chips at the same time

Prompt 7:
parseCards does not work

Prompt 8:
can you wrap the cards so that all cards are displayed on hte homepage without scrolling

Prompt 9:
increase the window size horizontally so i can fit the cards in a 3x5 format. I also somehow am losing a few cards -> there should be 15 cards

Prompt 10:
please verify that all 15 cards are displayed

Prompt 11:
add functionality to save the game state after every move made

Prompt 12:
implement functionality to generate a new game at any point where the cards are randomly generated

Prompt 13:
make sure the generated cards require 0-3 tokens of a color with at least 2 of some color and at most 3 colors. Also make sure the more a card costs, the higher VP it's worth

Prompt 14:
card 10 costs 5 chips total, so it's VP should be higher

Prompt 15:
have a wider range of victory points, repeated chips are more difficult than a variety of chips of small amounts

Prompt 16:
player is only able to draw one token regardless of color, they should be able to draw 3 of different colors or or 2 of the same color in a turn

Prompt 17:
the player isn't prevented from drawing 2 different color chips and then drawing a chip of a drawn color

Prompt 18:
the invalid scenario described above is still considered valid
 
// from the output for prompt 17
// Updated chip drawing validation:

// Valid scenario 1: Draw Red → Draw Red (2 same color, turn ends)
// Valid scenario 2: Draw Red → Draw Blue → Draw Green (3 different colors, turn ends)
// Invalid scenario: Draw Red → Draw Blue → Draw Red (rejected on 3rd draw)

// *gave up on getting vscode to write the logic, so manually edited the chip drawing functionality*
Prompt 19:
implement logic to stop the game if it's over and to display a popup to starta new game or quit
